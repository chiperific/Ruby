## Fizzbuzz

**Rules:** Output a set of numbers (say, 1-15), but whenever a number is divisible by 3, you output “Fizz” instead. If it’s divisible by 5, you output “Buzz” instead. If it’s divisible by 3 and 5, you output “FizzBuzz” instead.

** Steps: **

1. Accomplish this through a simple script.
    * [fizzbuzz_s1.rb](https://github.com/chiperific/Ruby/blob/master/fizzbuzz_s1.rb)
2. Write that script inside a single method that accepts an argument of how many numbers to output.
    * [fizzbuzz_s2.rb](https://github.com/chiperific/Ruby/blob/master/fizzbuzz_s2.rb)
3. Alter your method so that it collects the results and returns them to the caller.
    * [fizzbuzz_s3.rb](https://github.com/chiperific/Ruby/blob/master/fizzbuzz_s3.rb)
4. Wrap your method in a class that also implements methods returning output as plain-text, JSON and HTML.
    * [fizzbuzz_s4.rb](https://github.com/chiperific/Ruby/blob/master/fizzbuzz_s4.rb)

5. Test your code with RSpec. Trying to use 15, "fifteen", and nil as arguments.

7. Use the Sinatra framework to make your gem accessible from any web browser, deploying your final version to Heroku. Try using Twitter Bootstrap to give it a bit of flair.
